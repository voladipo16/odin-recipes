    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
        <h3>Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, rich tomato or meat sauce, creamy ricotta or b√©chamel, and melted cheeses like mozzarella and Parmesan. Each layer is stacked and baked until the flavors meld together, creating a hearty, cheesy, and comforting meal with a golden, bubbling top.</h3>

<h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>
            <ol>
                <li>1. Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
                <li>2. Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
                <li>3. Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
                <li>4. Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
                <li>5. Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
                <li>6. In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered).</li>
